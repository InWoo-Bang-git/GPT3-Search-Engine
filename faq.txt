Answer: Online education utilises breakthrough web technologies to deliver academic courses. When undertaking online study, students may use a range of tools such as webinars, videos, chat sessions and e-texts to deliver content. Assessments can be undertaken synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous learning refers to situations where online participation from a student is required at a certain time. This may involve a live discussion session with an online tutor, or a presentation which is only available to be viewed at that time. Asynchronous learning involves study where the event is not in a live format, but it may still have a loose timeframe, for example: an assessment that will be accessible at any time over a week long period. Both of these learning styles are utilised to their optimum when studying with Swinburne Online.

Question 80: What is Higher Education?

Answer: Higher education encompasses Bachelor level degrees and above and is offered by universities. Whether you’re entering or re-entering the workforce, changing career paths or simply want to broaden your expertise, higher education will help you achieve your career goals with courses ranging from bachelor degrees, masters degrees, doctorates and more. Each course requires different commitments in terms of time, cost and pre-requisite or foundation study or experience.

Question 81: What is HECS-HELP?

Answer:  The HECS‑HELP scheme can benefit an undergraduate domestic student (for example an Australian citizen studying a Bachelor degree at Swinburne Online) as a student loan. Instead of paying upfront, HECS-HELP is how eligible students can pay their student contribution amount.

Question 82: What is Distance Education?

Answer: Distance education (sometimes known as learning by correspondence) is a broad term that describes education delivered to a student who is in a separate location to the source of the academic content. This method of education has been around since the 1800s and in comparison with online education, which is offered by Swinburne Online, it is often viewed by professionals as outdated. The mode of delivery traditionally involves sending the course materials and assessments back and forth between the student and learning institution in hard copy. Many distance education programs require the student to attend classes or workshops on campus at some stage during the semester.

Question 83: What is an Honours Degree?

Question 88: What is a pre-requisite?

Answer: A pre-requisite subject is a subject or sequence of subjects which must be completed before choosing a subsequent unit or course. For example, an undergraduate student cannot choose postgraduate units at Swinburne Online.

Question 89: What is a PhD?

Answer: A Doctor of Philosophy, or PhD, is a globally recognised qualification that’s considered the highest postgraduate achievement an individual can earn. To be awarded with a PhD, you must select a specific subject within your chosen field, carry out extensive and original research and submit a substantial thesis on your findings. Your thesis will be assessed by external examiners and will be judged on the quality of original research and contribution to the knowledge of the subject. You’ll be required to commit to three or four years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent) and will be supervised by academic staff members. Once you graduate, you’ll be eligible to teach in your chosen field at a university level or work in a specialised position.

Question 90: What is a Masters Degree?

Answer: A Masters Degree allows you to become a specialist in your chosen field. Typically students are required you to demonstrate a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. When you graduate, you’ll possess advanced knowledge of a specialised body of theoretical and applied topics, high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. You will generally be required to undertake academic coursework and in some cases, preparation for professional practice.

 

Question 91: What is a major unit?

Answer: A major unit refers to what ‘specialisation’ you would like to focus on within your degree. For example, as a Bachelor of Business Administration student, you may wish to major in a specialisation area such as marketing. For current students, more information can be found in the Study Resources section of our Student Portal.

 

Question 92: What is a Graduate Diploma?

Answer: A Graduate Diploma will allow you to complete specialisation studies in a smaller amount of time and at a reduced cost of a Masters degree. Most of the time you will also have the option of transferring to a masters degree in the same topic. Once you complete your graduate diploma, you’ll have advanced knowledge and skills for professional, highly skilled work or further learning.

 

Question 93: What is a Graduate Certificate?

Answer: Completing a Graduate Certificate will help you upgrade your qualifications or give you advanced practical skills required in specialist industries. If you haven’t earned a bachelor degree, many programs may allow you entry provided you have sufficient relevant work experience in your chosen field. Graduate Certificates generally require a commitment of six months full-time study, or an equivalent part-time commitment.

Question 94: What is a Grade Point Average (GPA)?

Answer: A GPA is a calculation for higher education results. There are two GPA scales commonly used in Australia and overseas, the four-point and the seven-point scale. These scales differ in the grade points that they allocate to each grade but the method of calculation is the same. Swinburne uses a four-point method. To find out how to calculate a GPA visit our Grade Point Average page.

Question 95: What is a good option for upskilling during this time?

Answer: The best study option for you will depend on your current level of education, as well as the amount of available time you have to commit. For those looking to step up and earn a promotion or just upskill in general, a short course might be the best choice. A Graduate Certificate is also a good option for anyone looking to be educated over a short period of time. If you are unsure about what level of study or time commitment is best for you, utilise our Study Time Calculator or view our range of courses today.

Question 96: What is a Double Degree?

Answer: A double degree is a university degree where you study two single degrees at the same time, giving you the option of specialising in two different fields. To be eligible to enrol in a double degree, you must meet all the entry requirements of both degree programs. Even though you’ll be doubling your opportunities and giving yourself more career flexibility once you graduate, a double degree generally doesn’t take double the time to complete. In most instances, you’ll benefit from cross-crediting elective units, which will reduce your study costs and time compared to if you were studying separate bachelor degrees at different times. Usually a double degree will take four years full time study or part-time equivalent.

Question 97: What is a Diploma?

Answer: Completing a Diploma or Advanced Diploma certificate will give you practical skills for work as well as the opportunity to progress to another qualification. At Swinburne, you’ll be taught by experienced teachers and have access to equipment used in industry to help prepare you for your future.

Question 98: What is a Commonwealth Supported Place?

Answer: The Australian Government subsidises an Australian citizen student’s education by giving them a Commonwealth supported place. By doing this they are paying part of the course fees directly to the university and the student pays the remainder. If you are a domestic undergraduate student, you are eligible for a Commonwealth supported place.

 

Question 99: What is a Certificate?

Answer: Certificates are the most basic qualification available to secondary school students and beyond. Offered by TAFEs, Community Education Centres and Registered Training Providers, Certificates I, II, III and IV will prepare you for employment or further education and training. Certificate I: Will give you skills when beginning a profession or help you gain community involvement. Certificate II: You’ll build on knowledge and skills to work in a defined context and undertake further learning. Certificate III: You’ll learn more in-depth theoretical and practical skills for work or further learning. Certificate IV: You’ll learn theoretical and practical skills for specialised work or further learning.

Question 100: What is a Bachelor Degree?

Answer: Bachelor degrees are offered by universities and are presented to you when you complete an undergraduate course of study. Depending on the field of study, the duration of the degree can range from three to five years of full-time study (or part-time equivalent). Most bachelor degrees are recognised worldwide. A Bachelor degree teaches you skills such as research and analytical thinking and is recognised as a higher qualification to diplomas or certificates. Where a Diploma will give you the skills you need for your job, a Bachelor will set you up for your career.

 

Question 101: What happens if I don’t pay my fees on time?

Answer: It is your responsibility to ensure that your enrolment is correct prior to the due date. If you do not pay your fees by the due date you may be cancelled from your degree. If you withdraw from a unit after the due date you will receive a fail result on your student record. For TAFE students, your course won’t begin until you’ve paid your fees, or submitted your VET FEE HELP form.

Question 109: What are electives and why do I need to study them?

Answer: Electives are free choice units that must be completed to meet the requirements for most of our degrees.
